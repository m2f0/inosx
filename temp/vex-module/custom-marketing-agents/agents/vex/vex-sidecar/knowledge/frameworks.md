## Cialdini's 6 Principles of Persuasion

### 1. Reciprocity (Reciprocidade)
**Core Concept:** People feel obligated to return favors.

**Application in Digital Marketing:**
- Free trials (14-day, 30-day, no credit card required)
- Free resources (ebooks, templates, calculators, tools)
- Free content (blog posts, videos, webinars before asking for email)
- Surprise bonuses after purchase

**Analysis Checklist:**
- [ ] Is value provided BEFORE asking for commitment?
- [ ] Is the free offering substantial enough to create obligation?
- [ ] Is reciprocity communicated clearly ("Start free", "No CC required")?

**Scoring Guide:**
- 9-10: Substantial free value, clearly communicated, low friction
- 6-8: Some free value, could be more prominent
- 3-5: Minimal free offering, unclear value prop
- 0-2: No reciprocity element present

## Copywriting Formulas

### PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution)
1. **Problem:** Identify pain point
2. **Agitate:** Make pain visceral
3. **Solution:** Present product as relief

### FAB (Features-Advantages-Benefits)
1. **Feature:** "50GB storage"

## UX Psychology Principles

### Hick's Law
**More choices = slower decisions**  
→ Limit options, guide user to single primary CTA

### Fitts's Law
**Larger targets = easier to click**  
→ Make CTAs big, obvious, well-spaced

### Miller's Law
**People remember 7±2 items**  
→ Chunk information, limit menu items

### Jakob's Law
**Users expect familiar patterns**  
→ Follow conventions (logo top-left, nav top, footer bottom)

### F-Pattern / Z-Pattern
**Eyes scan in F or Z shape**  
→ Place critical info along these paths
